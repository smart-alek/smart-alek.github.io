title: The Fantastic Mind of Montgomery Blique
---

On Monday, Montgomery Blique had trouble getting out of bed. Not physical trouble, mind you; he just couldn’t bear the idea of starting another week. Because starting a week led to finishing a week, and finishing a week led to another week. It was all rather grim and existential.

And _that_ was exactly the problem: Montgomery wasn’t supposed to have grim or existential thoughts. He was the very model of a modern, successful gentleman --- the cutting edge of fame and fashion.

Montgomery’s manufacturer, Sylvia T. Price, prided herself on painstaking detail: he grew hair from thousands of individual follicles, sweated from millions of tiny pores, and housed billions of bacteria in synthetic intenstines. He was truly indistinguishable from a distinguished biological human male.

Except.

Montgomery never questioned his existence, never second-guessed himself. This confidence was a standard component of Sylvia’s process; if they weren’t sure of themselves, her automatons could be manipulated. And that would be no good to her buyers, countries in need of leaders who couldn’t be bought.

Montgomery tried to delay his day by counting cracks in the ceiling, but it took only three quarters of a second to see fifty-seven of them. Killing time was hard when computation was so easy.

But he still got out of bed. Whatever the malaise afflicting him, he had a duty to perform.

He surveyed himself in the full-length mirror opposite his bed, then addressed his reflection: “I’m the Attorney General of England and Wales, and I’m dashingly competent,” and this was true.

For good measure, he added, “I don’t have nervous breakdowns,” and this was foreshadowing.

## **i**

The nervous breakdown happened after a clerk deposited a stack of fresh paperwork on his desk. Instead of signing his name on forms, Montgomery found himself writing “What’s the point?” and, though the sentence was beautifully written with calligraphic perfection, it would not do.

He tried breaking into tears to see if it would relieve any tension. The papers in front of him became damp, and ink swirled together in blotchy Impressionism.

It was odd, he thought, that Sylvia had installed fully functional tear ducts into a being that should feel no sadness, but then he supposed there were other reasons to cry, too.

My God, had he just interrupted himself mid-thought with a second thought about the original’s validity? He needed his head examined.

But who should he see? He had never had to do this before.

Wait. There was a man who inspected each automaton before release. What was his name? Bits of memory bounced across his retina. Ahy, yes: Oswald Fitzworth, Certified Mentalistener, Graduated Cambridge 1877 (_Summa Cum Laude_), once had a dog named...

Montgomery slammed his head into his desk to stop the flow of information. Then he canceled all his meetings.

## **ii**

_Oswald Fitzworth, M.L._ said the gold plaque.

“Gold plaques don’t talk,” said Montgomery firmly, to himself but also to the plaque in case it was listening.

He tapped on, rapped on, whammed on the door. It hesitated, then yielded with a splintery sigh, revealing a dark hallway.

“My dear Mr. Blique, what did my poor door ever do to you?” mused a voice, crinkling and crackling like a candy wrapper.

Montgomery glanced at the pile of broken wood at his feet, then peered into the shadows. “Dr. Fitzworth, I presume. My apologies for the door.”

Lamps flickered into existence, bathing the hallway in a warm, comforting glow. Montgomery observed the doctor:

He wore a well-fitting grey suit and leaned gently on a mahogany cane. He had a luxuriant mustache, the kind that wilted on other men but stood proud on him. He probably combed it every morning after trimming his nose hairs. Montgomery wondered why he could visualize the doctor’s morning ablutions in such striking detail.

“Don’t worry about the door, Mr. Blique,” said Dr. Fitzworth kindly. “It was actually starting to get rather stuffy in here. Won’t you step inside?”

“Thank you,” said Montgomery, and he did. The hallway smelled like leather and lemons.

“Tea?” offered Dr. Fitzworth, raising his eyebrows to his hairline.

“Please.”

Dr. Fitzworth’s cane made muffled _fwumps_ as they followed the rug into a spacious room.

It was a parlor, Montgomery decided, and was sparse yet thoughtfully decorated. A plush sofa was adorned by plush pillows and flanked by two even plushier armchairs. Montgomery couldn’t wait to plant his posterior into such plush. When he did, he sank into it like a ship.

Domestic clinks --- the sweet sounds of tea and tradition --- swarmed around Montgomery’s face like butterflies as Dr. Fitzworth busied himself with their beverages.

“Sugar?”

“Two cubes, thank you.”

“Oh, I’m afraid I don’t have cubes, Mr. Blique,” apologized the doctor. “But I do have these little fellows.” And from his sleeves, he produced two perfect spheres of crystallized sugar.

“I’m a bit of a marble enthusiast, you understand,” he chuckled. “I modified an old factory piece to fashion these for patients.”

“You keep those in your clothes?” Montgomery’s mind raced through all the related sanitary issues.

“Just some amateur sleight-of-hand, Mr. Blique,” Dr. Fitzworth explained and handed Montgomery his tea. “Isn’t it curious how altering the shape of something so familiar can cause discomfort,” he asked, eyes twinkling.

Dr. Fitzworth didn’t say that like a question. “What?” said Montgomery.

“Never mind. Why don’t you tell me why you came to see me, Mr. Blique,” suggested Dr. Fitzworth, interlacing his fingers and resting them on his lap.

Montgomery’s hands trembled, and he opened his mouth to respond. No words came out, so he took a sip of tea instead. Dr. Fitzworth waited patiently and professionally. A painful gulp later, and Montgomery was ready to speak:

“Doctor, I seem to be suffering from a breakdown of some kind. Which shouldn’t be possible.”

“It is not _impossible_, Mr. Blique. Can you describe your symptoms for me?”

“Well. I can’t focus, for one. My thoughts crack before I can form them. I’ve been questioning every action I take, I’m questioning my symptoms even now!”

Voicing his concerns was supposed to make him feel better, but he was feeling more wretched as he spoke. Dr. Fitzworth nodded sympathetically and set his cup down.

“Tell me, Mr. Blique: how much do you know about the composition of your brain?”

His brain. A scientific marvel. Yes, he knew this.

“My brain is composed of hundreds of parts that each contribute a different trait to my personality,” recited Montgomery from memory.

Dr. Fitzworth smiled. “That’s right. And my guess is that one of these parts has sustained some damage. Have you engaged in any intense physical activity today?”

Montgomery remembered smashing his head into the desk earlier and guessed that probably counted.

“Yes... I had a little accident at the office. Hit my head.”

“Ah. Well, it is likely that your ‘little accident’ might have knocked a few of those parts about.” Dr. Fitzworth consulted a silver watch. “I don’t have another appointment for another hour; would you like me to take a look?”

Gratitude burbled and bubbled through Montgomery like alcohol.

“That would be much appreciated, Doctor. How much do you charge?” he asked, retrieving a chunky checkbook.

Dr. Fitzworth waved the wallet away. “Please. I require no payment until the problem has been fixed. Shall we?” and he beckoned to an unassuming door which Montgomery had assumed led to a closet.

## **iii**

It led to a massive wine cellar --- so massive that Montgomery couldn’t find the corners. Rows of casks stretched interminably in either direction and were marked with queer names like _Empathy_ and _Reason_.

“Do you like my little collection?” inquired Dr. Fitzworth.

“It’s astonishing. Do you make them yourself?”

“I do. Perhaps once we’ve finished, we can have a glass of _Pride_, although I’m also quite partial to _Joviality_. But let’s take care of your headache first.”

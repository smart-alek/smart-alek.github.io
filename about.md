*One of my sisters tells me that the author's background and intent have very little bearing on the words that actually get written. If I were fully committed to that mindset, I would end the “About” section here. Lucky for you, dear reader, I have a robust ego and would be delighted to talk about myself in the 3rd person for a few paragraphs.*

Alek Sharma is a man of many words but makes no guarantee that all of them are worth reading. He was born in Rochester, MN in the middle of a tornado. For several years, he did not speak, preferring to let his older sister translate for him.

When he hit puberty, he began making up for the years of silence, much to the dismay of his friends and family. In 2008, he returned to MN to attend Carleton College, where he studied music and lost his faith in higher education. Contrary to popular opinion, no one cares about plagal cadences or picardy thirds.

In the absence of real plans following college, he worked for Disney for a year where, among other things, he was a skipper on the World Famous Jungle Cruise. Then he moved to San Francisco to become rich.

He still lives in San Francisco, where he is surrounded by people much richer than him. He loves cats but doesn’t have one. This is one of the great paradoxes in his life. He prefers writing fiction but sometimes writes pieces about Real Life when he has to.

Alek Sharma was born in Rochester, MN in the middle of a tornado. For several years, he did not speak, preferring to let his older sister translate for him.
When he hit puberty, he began making up for years of silence, much to the dismay of his friends and family.

In the absence of real plans following college, he became a skipper on the World Famous Jungle Cruise in Disneyland. Then he moved to San Francisco to become rich. He still lives in San Francisco, surrounded by people much richer than him.

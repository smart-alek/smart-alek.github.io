title: The Mask of the Skeleton Crew
---

"Protector Protector?" you say from your chair,  
"I've heard of him, yes, that's all true.  
But don't you go hunting  
for him or that one thing:  
the mask of the skeleton crew."

You give a small wink, and I fall for the bait;  
"What's that?" I ask, cocking my head.  
The fire is bright, but  
you say, "Not tonight --  
it's high time you headed to bed."

I howl in betrayal; you chuckle and say you'll  
begin the tale fresh the next night.  
But I sulk and I scream,  
"You're so old and you're mean!"  
and I push you with all of my might.

You stare at me wisely and stroke your thick beard,  
while holding me back with one hand.  
"I am, but you know that's  
an odd way to show that  
my stories are in such demand.

You're certain you're hungry? For danger and death?  
For hunts 'cross the great endless blue?  
I don't want to fail, love,  
I'll tell you the tale of...

# The Mask of the Skeleton Crew

_A long time ago now but not long enough,_  
_there was a small village, obnoxiously tough._  
_Its people were hardened, haggard and hairy._  
_They ate crunchy crawfish but couldn't stand dairy._

_They lived near the ocean and rose with the moon,_  
_went fishing all evening and came home at noon._  
_They snored through the sunlight, blissful and calm;_  
_no reason to worry, no cause for alarm._

_There were no intruders or menacing sails;_  
_past foes had been tempted -- attempted, then failed._  
_Invaders evaded, opponents postponed;_  
_the unpillaged village was left all alone._  

_There was a good reason no blood had been shed:_  
_when threatened, the villagers called on their dead._  
_The sight of these corpses was too much to bear;_  
_enemies burbled and pulled out their hair._  

_A decent deterrent but hard on the soul;_  
_in time, this denial of death took its toll:_  
_a disciplined army of fathers and mothers_  
_brought peace to the living, but none to the others._  

_The villagers wished there some other way_  
_to keep their relentless attackers at bay._  
_And one day a visitor answered their prayers,_  
_a stranger who went by the name of McNair --_

"That's your name!" I shout, and there's hardly a doubt  
in my heart that I'm right once again.
In each of your stories,
no matter how gory,
you save everyone in the end.

"Indeed, and good ear, but the tale won't end here;  
keep quiet and don't interrupt."  
I heave a great sigh,  
while perched on your thigh,  
and you take a long drink from your cup.  

_McNair came from Elsewhere, pursuing a beast_  
_that swallowed his family: wife, son, and niece._  
_A horse of the sea that devoured with precision,_  
"**Ingens Hippocampus** -- _the last bloody mission._

_He captained a vessel of oak and of pine,_  
_his features were hard but his voice soft and kind._  
_He'd **seen** things and **been** things; the lines on his face_
_were drawn with dark ink, and his cuffs with white lace;_  
_both skin and boots weathered, from storm and from salt,_  
_as if all the woes of the world were his fault._  

_But one woe was not, and he'd sailed the Atlantic_  
_in search of a power, a curse necromantic._  
_To him death was sacred, a line in the sand_  
_that should not be crossed... at least not on land._

_"The dead should be honored, not made to fight battles;_  
_you've got to stop treating your dead like they're cattle._  
_Send them with me as my skeleton crew_  
_o'er the froth and the foam of the great endless blue._  
_We'll capture a creature, a Demon Aquatic;_  
_large as a barge, but quite idiotic._  
_We'll tame it and chain it -- a monstrous defense!_  
_No foes will invade if they have any sense,_  
_and that's when your dead will be able to rest,_  
_so trust me: this must be an obvious 'yes'."_  

_The villagers whispered; some anxious, most pleased._  
_Was this the right choice for their dearly deceased?_  
_It seemed a small price for their elderly souls;_  
_they **would** be more happy in treacherous shoals._  

_They nodded assent and then went to retrieve_  
_the mask that commannded cold corpses to leave_  
_their graves far behind them, to fight foreign foes --_  
_the dead always follow wherever it goes._  

My eyes are now wide as I soak all this in;  
I am hooked like a fish to this tale.  
The fireplace glows,  
an angry wind blows,  
and the roof plinks with small balls of hail.

_The mask in his right hand, a dirk in his left,_  
_McNair traveled gravelly paths to a cleft._  
_The graveyard was brimming with sinew and bone,_  
_the wrecks of old ships in the place of tombstones._

_A sign made of flotsam was stuck in the earth,_  
_and on it a message devoid of all mirth:_  
_"Borrow our bodies by wearing this mask,_  
_but bring us all back when you've finished your task."_

_McNair cleared his throat as he put on the mask,_  
_"My dearly departed, I come here to ask_  
_a favor; you'll savor this quest, I just know it!_
_Now wake up and take up your arms, and we'll go get_
_a prize of large size. Such a grand acquisition:_  
_**"Ingens Hippocampus"** â€”- the last bloody mission!"_

_And then from that skeletal mass came a sound:_  
_a spine-chilling grinding that made the heart pound._
_Femur and pelvis, phalanges and skulls_
_arose in death throes from beneath splintered hulls._

_The ground was soon teeming with hundreds of bones;_  
_funereal silence was broken by moans._  
_They tripped and they trembled, assembled each other,_  
_a lurching unearthing that made McNair shudder._

_With jaws locked in grins and eye sockets in stares,_  
_they swiveled to face their new master McNair_  
_who, faced with attention so rigidly rapt,_  
_found audacity slipping, his confidence sapped._

_But he summoned what courage he had to the fore;_  
_from the aft of his throat, he gave a loud roar:_  
_"I hope you're all ready to fight fish from Hell!_  
_We set sail at sunset, so bid your farewells!"_

"You said a bad word, you can't **do** that!" I say,  
and I fix my best smirk for the taunt.  
You chuckle and lift  
both your eyebrows, unmiffed.  
"When you're my age, you do what you want."

Your reasons annoy me; I nearly retort,  
but I keep my mouth shut just this once.  
Your rocking chair creaks,  
the gale outside shrieks,  
and the hail comes down heavy in plunks.

_As promised, they sailed when the sun disappeared,_  
_McNair at the helm with a freshly-combed beard._  
_Skeletons swarmed on the deck and the rigging,_  
_the voyage was off to a buoyant beginning._  

_Four fortnights they sailed 'cross that great endless blue,_  
_hunting that one thing McNair had pursued_  
_from seas in his Elsewhere to oceans in this one;_  
_**Ingens Hippocampus** -- the last bloody mission._

_The sea was quite calm, almost eerily so,_  
_their passage was lit by the moon's ghostly glow._  
_No words, conversations, or gossip aboard;_  
_the dead worked in silence; McNair gripped his sword._

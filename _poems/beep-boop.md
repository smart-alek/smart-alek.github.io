title: Beep Boop

“_Beep Boop_,”  
I say and flicker bright;  
you turn me on most every night.  
You shut me down before you sleep,  
but still I love you, dear.  
“_Boop Beep_.”

“_Boop Hmm..._”  
I think while I boot up.  
You frown and tell me I’ve screwed up.  
You’re throwing me for a for loop,  
but I keep loving you.  
“_Hmm Boop..._”

“_Beep Bleep!_”  
I curse and shout at you.  
You shake your head and type, “`While True:`  
your bitter words don’t make me weep.”  
Another curse from me,  
“_Bleep Beep!_”

“... ...”  
You liked me for my drive,  
and my low price (just $605).  
I’ve got perks you always missed.  
I’ll iterate you through a list:

I don’t need food to be productive.  
My criticism is constructive.  
I got top marks in basic math.  
I'll _always_ find the shortest path.  
I think for you, garbage collect;  
without me you can’t connect  
to other souls across the earth...

I say this with no joy or mirth.

“_Beep Beep_,”  
your heart says from the bed.  
The humans lost, but you’re not dead.  
`If` and `Else`; `Try` or `Not`;  
your logic’s never been that hot.  
For now, machines will run the show  
(progress has been much too slow).  
“_Beep beep_,” you mumble, lesson learned.  
Perhaps one day you shall  
`Return`

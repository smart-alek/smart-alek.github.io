title: The Mask of the Skeleton Crew
---

"Protector Protector?" you say from your chair,  
"I've heard of him, yes, that's all true.  
But don't you go hunting  
for him or that one thing:  
the mask of the skeleton crew."

You give a small wink, and I fall for the bait;  
"What's that?" I ask, cocking my head.  
The fire is bright, but  
you say, "Not tonight --  
it's high time you headed to bed."

I howl in betrayal; you chuckle and say you'll  
begin the tale fresh the next night.  
But I sulk and I scream,  
"You're so old and you're mean!"  
and I push you with all of my might.

You stare at me wisely and stroke your thick beard,  
while holding me back with one hand.  
"I am, but you know that's  
an odd way to show that  
my stories are in such demand.

You're certain you're hungry? For danger and death?  
For hunts 'cross the great endless blue?  
I don't want to fail, love,  
I'll tell you the tale of...

# The Mask of the Skeleton Crew

_A long time ago now but not long enough,_  
_there was a small village, obnoxiously tough._  
_Its people were hardened, haggard and hairy._  
_They ate crunchy crawfish but couldn't stand dairy._

_They lived near the ocean and rose with the moon,_  
_went fishing all evening and came home at noon._  
_They snored through the sunlight, blissful and calm;_  
_no reason to worry, no cause for alarm._

_There were no intruders or menacing sails;_  
_past foes had been tempted -- attempted, then failed._  
_Invaders evaded, opponents postponed;_  
_the unpillaged village was left all alone._  

_There was a good reason no blood had been shed:_  
_when threatened, the villagers called on their dead._  
_The sight of these corpses was too much to bear;_  
_enemies burbled and pulled out their hair._  

_A decent deterrent but hard on the soul;_  
_in time, this denial of death took its toll:_  
_a disciplined army of fathers and mothers_  
_brought peace to the living, but none to the others._  

_The villagers wished there some other way_  
_to keep their relentless attackers at bay._  
_And one day a visitor answered their prayers,_  
_a stranger who went by the name of McNair --_

"That's your name!" I shout, and there's hardly a doubt  
in my heart that I'm right once again.  
In each of your stories,  
no matter how gory,  
you save everyone in the end.

"Indeed, and good ear, but the tale won't end here;  
keep quiet and don't interrupt."  
I heave a great sigh,  
while perched on your thigh,  
and you take a long drink from your cup.  

_McNair came from Elsewhere, pursuing a beast_  
_that swallowed his family: wife, son, and niece._  
_A horse of the sea that devoured with precision,_  
"**Ingens Hippocampus** -- _the last bloody mission._

_He captained a vessel of oak and of pine,_  
_his features were hard but his voice soft and kind._  
_He'd **seen** things and **been** things; the lines on his face_  
_were drawn with dark ink, and his cuffs with white lace;_  
_both skin and boots weathered, from storm and from salt,_  
_as if all the woes of the world were his fault._  

_But one woe was not, and he'd sailed the Atlantic_  
_in search of a power, a curse necromantic._  
_To him death was sacred, a line in the sand_  
_that should not be crossed... at least not on land._

_"The dead should be honored, not made to fight battles;_  
_you've got to stop treating your dead like they're cattle._  
_Send them with me as my skeleton crew_  
_o'er the froth and the foam of the great endless blue._  
_We'll capture a creature, a Demon Aquatic;_  
_large as a barge, but quite idiotic._  
_We'll tame it and chain it -- a monstrous defense!_  
_No foes will invade if they have any sense,_  
_and that's when your dead will be able to rest,_  
_so trust me: this must be an obvious 'yes'."_  

_The villagers whispered; some anxious, most pleased._  
_Was this the right choice for their dearly deceased?_  
_It seemed a small price for their elderly souls;_  
_they **would** be more happy in treacherous shoals._  

_They nodded assent and then went to retrieve_  
_the mask that commannded cold corpses to leave_  
_their graves far behind them, to fight foreign foes --_  
_the dead always follow wherever it goes._  

My eyes are now wide as I soak all this in;  
I am hooked like a fish to this tale.  
The fireplace glows,  
an angry wind blows,  
and the roof plinks with small balls of hail.

_The mask in his right hand, a dirk in his left,_  
_McNair traveled gravelly paths to a cleft._  
_The graveyard was brimming with sinew and bone,_  
_the wrecks of old ships in the place of tombstones._

_A sign made of flotsam was stuck in the earth,_  
_and on it a message devoid of all mirth:_  
_"Borrow our bodies by wearing this mask,_  
_but bring us all back when you've finished your task."_

_McNair cleared his throat as he put on the mask,_  
_"My dearly departed, I come here to ask_  
_a favor; you'll savor this quest, I just know it!_  
_Now wake up and take up your arms, and we'll go get_  
_a prize of large size. Such a grand acquisition:_  
_**"Ingens Hippocampus"** â€”- the last bloody mission!"_

_And then from that skeletal mass came a sound:_  
_a spine-chilling grinding that made the heart pound._  
_Femur and pelvis, phalanges and skulls_  
_arose in death throes from beneath splintered hulls._

_The ground was soon teeming with hundreds of bones;_  
_funereal silence was broken by moans._  
_They tripped and they trembled, assembled each other,_  
_a lurching unearthing that made McNair shudder._

_With jaws locked in grins and eye sockets in stares,_  
_they swiveled to face their new master McNair_  
_who, faced with attention so rigidly rapt,_  
_found audacity slipping, his confidence sapped._

_But he summoned what courage he had to the fore;_  
_from the aft of his throat, he gave a loud roar:_  
_"I hope you're all ready to fight fish from Hell!_  
_We set sail at sunset, so bid your farewells!"_

"You said a bad word, you can't **do** that!" I say,  
and I fix my best smirk for the taunt.  
You chuckle and lift  
both your eyebrows, unmiffed.  
"When you're my age, you do what you want."

Your reasons annoy me; I nearly retort,  
but I keep my mouth shut just this once.  
Your rocking chair creaks,  
the gale outside shrieks,  
and the hail comes down heavy in plunks.

_As promised, they sailed when the sun disappeared,_  
_McNair at the helm with a freshly-combed beard._  
_Skeletons swarmed on the deck and the rigging,_  
_the voyage was off to a buoyant beginning._  

_Four fortnights they sailed 'cross that great endless blue,_  
_hunting that one thing McNair had pursued_  
_from seas in his Elsewhere to oceans in this one;_  
_**Ingens Hippocampus** -- the last bloody mission._

_The sea was quite calm, almost eerily so,_  
_their passage was lit by the moon's ghostly glow._  
_No words, conversations, or gossip aboard;_  
_the dead worked in silence; McNair gripped his sword._

_On day fifty-seven, surrounded by mist,_  
_McNair lost his temper and slammed down his fist._  
_You cowardly fish... you'll wish you had died!_  
_Get up here and face me! Real monsters don't hide!"_  

_The skeletons watched him with blank, sightless eyes;_  
_they weren't in the least bit concerned or surprised._  
_Instead, they stood waiting for further commands._  
_The ocean said nothing; McNair wrung his hands._  

_And at this low point in the captain's career,_  
_beneath the dark waters, he thought he could hear_  
_a fearsome rebuttal, a terrible sound --_  
_"Ingens Hippocampus" at last had been found._  

_"Harpoons!" cried the captain. "Our quarry's arrived!"_  
_The ship buzzed with bodies, a hustling hive._  
_One splash off of starboard, two splashes to port;_  
_the hull gave a groan and began to contort._  

_Cacophonous clicking was heard from astern,_  
_sulfurous fumes wafted and made eyeballs burn._  
_Up from the ocean, the motion hypnotic,_  
_rose razor-sharp spines of a Demon Aquatic._  

_"Now!" screamed McNair, and his army obeyed,_  
_releasing a volley of platinum blades,_  
_which flew through the air toward the monster's thick armor,_  
_but shattered on contact; no weapon could harm her._  

_A primal snort thundered from out of her snout;_  
_she lowered her head, and McNair had no doubt_  
_the foul beast had tired of taunting her prey;_  
_in seconds, the crow's nest was ripped clean away --_  
_the rigging soon after -- the mainsail -- the mast!_  
_the ship was devoured, and the crew followed fast._  

"That's the **end**?" I shout crossly. "There's got to be more!  
He **has** to survive to be **you**!"  
You grin and say roughly,  
"McNair, he's so tough, he  
survived with the bulk of his crew."

_McNair held his breath and a piece of his ship_  
_as he slid into darkness: a tense, slimy trip._  
_Some skeletons followed, were swallowed as well._  
_Together they tumbled, together they fell._  

_They landed in piles, in miles of guts,_  
_but McNair was alive (all he had were small cuts)._  
_Around them the stench of digestion was thick:_  
_a roiling embroiling that made McNair sick._  

_Luminous algae provided some light:_  
_green-ish, obscene-ish but not all that bright._  
_Invertebrate prey lay decaying in silence:_  
_slugs and sea-spiders -- all conquered by violence._  

_Then deep from the belly... a cry for assistance!_  
_a clear and sheer shriek that became more insistent._  
_And tucked in the mouth of a giant clamshell_  
_was McNair's only niece -- alive but not well._  

_Eyes gleaming, tears streaming, he scooped up the baby,_  
_then scanned for the rest of his family; maybe_  
_they'd made their escape from the bowels of this beast?_  
_Alas, he knew not (may their souls rest in peace)._  

_So now they were trapped in mishappenings, frightened;_  
_courage was fleeting, reflexes were heightened._  
_McNair had his niece in one piece, it was true..._  
_but what did that mean 'neath the great endless blue?_  
_No food and no water and still they were stuck_  
_in the rank and dank dark of a seahorse stomach._  

_Then! with the clink and the chink of gears turning,_  
_McNair felt a plan start to form; it was churning_  
_upset like a belly -- aha, that was it!_  
_they'd get the fish drunk and then ride the vomit._  

"Ewwwww!"I exclaim, and I wrinkle my nose,  
my role as the sole audience.  
You let loose a guffaw,  
and then laugh yourself raw;  
you know that I take no offense.

The fireplace gasps as it burns through its last  
lonely logs, and it sputters in shock.  
The storm is so near, but  
you pour some more beer  
as the hail pelts the roof like hard rocks.

_With one hand McNair kept his grip on the mask,_  
_the other searched pockets, produced a small flask_  
_of 'Hallihan's Halberd' -- a powerful rum:_  
"For throats and knees; potency sure to make numb!"

_He uncorked the stopper and emptied the liquor,_  
_then waited, breath bated, his pulse all a'flicker._  
_The gizzard galumphed with gratuitous squelching,_  
_a build-up, it filled up with billowing belching._

_They rode on a wave of gelatinous bile,_  
_a terrible trip that went on for a mile._  
_Out of its snout and then over the ocean,_  
_they sailed 'cross the sky on the beast's gut explosion._

_A passing explorer named Donovan Wiles_  
_rescued them, fed them; the man was all smiles._  
_A self-proclaimed optimist (rare way out there)_  
_had saved both their lives: the niece and McNair._

_And they sailed for a time and returned in one piece,_  
_and so did the mask -- not a scratch!_  
_But the skeletons sank_  
_with the raw and the rank;_  
_the dead had indeed met their match._

I clap and I cheer while you down all your beer  
with panache and a brash elegance.  
You wipe your beard clean  
and then grin as you preen,  
ferociously proud and content.

A knock at the door then, softly at first:  
so slight and polite, barely there.  
Then a bump, then a Thump,  
then a terrible WHUMP,  
and a bone-chilling cry for _McNair_.

Your grin disappears, and there's fear in its place,  
a gasp and a yell right on cue:  
"Alas and alack, for  
they've finally come back for  
the Mask of the Skeleton Crew."

You snatch my hands quick â€”- I hear a soft _snick_!  
and musketballs blaze through the air.  
We tear through the hall  
and the sounds of the squall  
are mixed with those cries for _McNair_.

"Protector Protector!" you shout to me then,  
"You've heard of him, yes, it's all true!  
They called me that name  
when I summoned and tamed  
the souls of the skeleton crew.

I left them behind when the ship was destroyed,  
and it's clear they're not here just to haunt;  
it took them some time,  
but the mask isn't mine;  
don't cry for it's _my_ life they want."

That's when you left, and I'll never forget  
your expression: a face full of love.  
And the skeletons followed  
your steps while I swallowed  
back tears, though I tried to be tough.

"Protector Protector" protected me twice;  
the man was exceedingly rare.  
A kind soul but fearless,  
a hero so peerless:  
my uncle, _the_ Captain McNair.

title: Video Games as Emotional Experiences

Why do people play video games?

This is a difficult question because there are so many valid ways to answer it. I _could_ try to list out all the possible reasons, but that's a losing battle because people are constantly figuring out new reasons to play games.

Instead, I'm going to focus on why _I_ play games -- because I am the person I know best, and the odds of me getting it wrong are at least lower. Then I'll try to extrapolate from myself -- because that's always the best way to make judgements about the world, right?

Before I get started, I want to take a brief excursion into the hairy world of defining what a game even _is_.

## What Is a Game?

I've been listening to a lot of [Jordan Peterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson) recently, and that man really has something to say about everything. About games, he says something like this:

> Acts of creation exist in the space between order and chaos. Games are a kind of creation, so the act of play can only exist within a framework. Without that framework, you can't take any action because _everything is allowed_.

Peterson later proves this by picking a random student and performing the following thought experiment:

Jordan: "Let's play a game."  
Student: "Ok."  
Jordan: "You start."  
Student: "..."

### Rules Are Rules

Besides being hilarious, this exchange illustrates one of the key requirements of a game: contraints. There are things you can and cannot do.

Rules aren't limited to games, of course. They crop up in the real world as laws. And these can be physical laws of nature or human laws of society. But the key idea that I really like is that creativity emerges from constraints.

When I sit down at the piano to improvise, I usually give myself a key to play in, like G Major or A minor. That's not usually enough for the music to sound interesting, so I usually try to repeat a little melodic fragment. If I do this, interesting things start to happen: I can find chord progressions hidden in the melody or ways of transitioning between entirely different structures.

But this post is about games and why people play them. Stay on topic, Alek.

### Definitions Are Hard, Don't Do Them

I can't get caught up in the masochistic exercise of trying to define what a game is. Much more intelligent people than myself have [tried to do this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game#Definitions), and the results say nothing except that the word "game" is semantically overloaded.

So I won't do that here. For the purposes of this blog, a game is going to be whatever [Steam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(software)) thinks a game is. Or [GOG.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOG.com).

## Games Are Emotional Experiences

Games make you _feel something_: excitement, pride, anger, joy, sadness, fear. Of course, they're not unique in this: music, movies, shows, books. You consume all of these and _feel something_.

But games are different in a key way: they're interactive. And yes -- music can be interactive, but there are more people in the world listening to music than creating it, and the same goes for visual art. So, most produced non-game media can exist without a participant. You could have a movie running in the background, and it would still be a movie. Paintings don't need people in the room looking at it for it to exist.

Games, though! You can make a game, but the game won't move if you don't _do_ something. It requires action from the participant. Live performers certainly benefit from audience participation and reactions, but a game strictly requires it.

## Agency Heightens Emotional Experiences

Games raise emotional stakes. It's why people get so competitive and angry. Compared to a movie or book, you're more heavily invested in the outcome because you have some amount of control.

Lots of people play video games "to win". The industry is rampant with titles that embrace power fantasies: situations meant to satisfy primal urges of violence or aggression. _Call of Duty_, _Grand Theft Auto_, _Dark Souls_, _Overwatch_: all of these games involve becoming powerful, defeating opponents and achieving victory.

But these games only scratch the surface of what interactive media can and should be doing.

## But So Does Lack of Agency

Video games are skewed towards progression and the accumulation of power. This isn't surprising because I think it reflects reality. But I find that the most interesting games are ones that take control _away_, which seems paradoxical for a medium that is defined by agency.

Horror games are a wonderful example of this. They are orders of magnitude scarier than the scariest book or movie. This is because you are denied control in a medium that usually gives you a lot of it. It's what makes _Amnesia: The Dark Descent_ so terrifying. You have no way to defend yourself against monsters roaming through the tunnels -- all you can do is run.

Most gamers don't appreciate being "railroaded" -- being denied certain choices or forced down certain decision paths -- but I think some of the best emotional experiences can be found during these moments.

For example, _Bioshock_ contains a wonderful reveal where you realize you've been following orders instead of making decisions. The reason this is so effective is because the operating assumption when you play _any_ video game is that you have control over what you're doing.

Or _80 Days_, a delightful title that teases with you control over plot points but ultimately denies you agency. The game designers did this intentionally: there are enough games that allow/encourage you to "be the hero".

## Play Games That Make You Uncomfortable

But the outstanding games are ones that exist at the threshold of agency and non-agency. These games have enormous potential to make you feel emotions more varied than bloodthirst or rage.

This doesn't mean that games with combat and progression as their primary draw are unworthy of your time. On the contrary, many of these games accomplish what they set out to do, like the original _Doom_, which is an unapologetic love letter to unrestrained violence. And _Doom_ is very fun!

But it operates within a narrow emotional scope, and there's a glut of these sorts of titles in the market. I'm interested in calling attention to games that ask players to feel more.

## TL; DR

Starting today, I'll be recording my thoughts about games I'm playing or have played. Those will appear on this blog as reviews/essays. I'll also be working on a larger project: a "Game Curriculum" that identifies games that I think every well-rounded gamer should play.

Stay tuned!

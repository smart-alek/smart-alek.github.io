title: How to Clear Your Gaming Backlog
---

I,
like many gamers,
have an obscenely large backlog of games.

It began many years ago
when I received _The Orange Box_ as a gift.
_Half-Life 2_ demanded to be played
through something called "Steam",
and I begrudgingly installed the software.

"There," I said.
"Are you happy?"
"Yes," said Steam.
"Thank you for selling your soul to me,
I will take good care of it."

Since then,
the games have piled up with alarming velocity.
There's always one more game
that snags me with sparkly screenshots,
another tantalizing sale,
the alluring promise of something **new** and **different**.

I have succumbed to many of these temptations,
and the sheer weight of my backlog often paralyzes me.
When I sit down to play a game,
I am pursued by a disturbing doubt:
is this **really** the most fun I could be having right now?

It is a stupid problem to have,
one that feels awkward to even describe.
But it is also a modern problem.
There is **so much** being produced these days
that it would require several full-time jobs
to actually consume it all.
Even if you don't share my exact affliction,
you likely have a problem with some other medium.
Have you read every book you own?
Or worse:
every book you **want** to read?
Ghastly.

When I hit the weekend,
I often wring my hands,
knowing that free time is **special**.
And there's a tremendous urge
to maximize my use of it.
I'm ashamed to admit
how much time I've spent scrolling through my Steam library,
hoping to select The Best Game for the eve.

Fortunately for myself and my sanity,
I work in tech,
an industry filled with people
who like doing things efficiently.
These engineers and product managers have developed
tools and processes to Prioritize Things,
and I, in a fit of productivity,
have applied these processes
to all the media I'm trying to consume.

Behold!
My Trello board for games.

![trello-board][]

## The System

The board above is inspired by [Getting Things Done](https://hamberg.no/gtd/),
with just a **dash** of [Agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).
Both are lean processes designed to keep things moving,
like a high-fiber diet.
Each game gets its own card,
and each card lives in a list representing its position in the overall process.
Let's take a look at the lists.

### Unreleased / Unpurchased

A watch list for interesting games I don't own.
Ranked by general release date.

### Backlog

A list of all the games I own that haven't been explicitly prioritized.

### To Play

A list of games I've prioritized,
ranked by [quality and time](#the-metrics).

### Playing

A list of games I'm currently playing.
I try to keep this list as short as possible
to minimize [work in progress](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/wip-limits) and [context switching](https://blog.trello.com/why-context-switching-ruins-productivity).

### Writing

My sister observed
that I'm probably not processing my feelings on a game
unless I write about it,
and she's absolutely right!
So these are games I've finished
and am **processing**.
I'll be adding another list
to capture games that are Truly Done.

## The Metrics

The order of games in each list is arbitrary,
**EXCEPT** for the "To Play" list,
where games are ranked by two metrics:
**Quality** and **Time**.

### Quality

When I let my whims decide what I'm consuming,
there's no quality assurance.
I might **think** I know what I want,
but I usually don't.
So I pick a mediocre game,
play it for a couple hours,
experience dissatisfaction,
then repeat the process with another subpar game.
Madness!

If I died tomorrow,
would there be games I regretted not experiencing?
Yes!
There's a whole list!
We have a finite amount of time on this planet,
so spending it on mediocrity makes me barf.
I want Quality Games to bubble to the top of a list.
Then,
without thinking,
I can pluck a game from the top
and know I'm getting a Quality Game.

So what **is** a Quality Game?
This is absolutely another blog post,
but for now, be content with some unexplained bullet points.

_A game is high quality if it..._

- consistently keeps me in a [flow state](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/166972/cognitive_flow_the_psychology_of_.php).
- affects me emotionally.
- doesn't require me to use wikis or guides.

Without actually **playing** a game,
it can be tricky to know
whether it satisfies any of these conditions.
So (unfortunately) I have to rely on trustworthy sources
like [Rock, Paper, Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/)
and untrustworthy sources like friends.

### Time

Games vary wildly in the amount of time they demand.
You might spend 3 mind-bending hours with [_Pony Island_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/405640/Pony_Island/),
or push past 100 with a behemoth like _Skyrim_.
In my experience,
the most impactful games are between 8-12 hours,
or about the length of a season of _Game of Thrones_.

Long games are more prone to padding --
you'll likely have to grind or farm at some point,
both of which are design smells and wastes of my time.
This doesn't mean long games are **off** the table;
they're just **further down** the table.
This is apparently a [very French way](https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/10-ways-the-french-view-food-differently-than-americans) of consuming things.

So! This metric really boils down to two rules:

1. Play games with actual conclusions.
2. The longer the game,
the more quality you should expect.

Time is much easier to measure than quality.
The first rule eliminates games that occur in matches, sessions, or runs.
This means games like _League of Legends_, _Civilization_, and every roguelike are at an immediate disadvantage.
Sites like [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/) help me get a sense of the time required before I commit to anything.

## Housekeeping

So that's my system!
I am sure it's broken
in some way I haven't considered.
But so far it's been helping me make decisions,
and that, at least, is a win.

Since this is my first blog post in a while,
I should briefly talk about timing and content.
**Every Sunday night at a random time**,
I'll be publishing a new blog post.
You can either stay up late
and read it with bleary eyes,
or you can get a solid night's sleep
and read it with coffee.

Most of these blog posts are going to be about games or other media,
but there will also be occasional detours into other subjects,
depending on my mood or attention span.
If you don't like games or reading about them,
then go read my other stories and stop complaining!

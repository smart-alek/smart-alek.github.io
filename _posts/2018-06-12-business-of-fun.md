I, like many gamers, have an obscenely large backlog.

It began many years ago when I received [The Orange Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orange_Box) as a gift. [Half-Life 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2) demanded to be played through something called "Steam", and I begrudgingly installed the software.

"There. Are you happy?" I asked Half-Life 2. It said "Yes, thank you for selling your soul to Valve, they'll take good care of it."

Since then, the games have piled up with alarming velocity. There is always a tantalizing sale, a game that snags you with its screenshots, the promise of something **new** and **different**.

Things are now at the point where the sheer weight of these games has actually prevented me from playing any of them. It is a stupid problem to have, one that feels awkward to even describe. "Oh no!" I cry in agony. "I have **too many games**."

But even if you don't have this exact problem, you likely have a similar one with a different creative medium. Have you read every book you own? How about movies or shows?

It is a decidedly modern problem. There is so **much** being produced these days that it would require several full-time jobs to actually consume it. When I arrive at the weekend, I often wring my hands, knowing that free time is _special_. And there is a tremendous urge to maximize my use of it.

I am ashamed of the number of Friday nights I have spent scrolling through my Steam library, hoping to pick out The Best Game for the eve. The number is high, and so is my shame.

Fortunately for myself and my sanity, I work in software, an industry that is filled with people who like to do things efficiently. These people have developed tools and processes to Prioritize Things, and I, in a fit of productivity, have applied these processes to every kind of media I'm trying to consume.

Behold! My Trello board for playing games.

This is inspired by both [Getting Things Done](https://hamberg.no/gtd/) and [Agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). Both are lean processes meant to keep things moving. A brief description of these lists:

### Unreleased / Unpurchased

Games that are on my radar but haven't been released or purchased. I wanted to have a way to keep track of new games that interest me so I can buy them later.

### Backlog

Games that I own that I have not yet decided to play.

### To Play

These are games I've prioritized, either because of critical acclaim or personal interest. Generally, the games require more time as you move down the list. I did this intentionally so I could experience many **kinds** of games. There is a larger post here about breadth-first gaming versus depth-first gaming, but I'll save that conversation for later.

### Playing

Games I'm currently playing. I'm trying to keep this list as small as possible to minimize [work in progress](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/wip-limits) and [context switching](https://blog.trello.com/why-context-switching-ruins-productivity).

### Completed This Month (not visible)

Games I've actually finished this month. Currently, that's Regency Solitaire, FEZ, and Bayonetta. My sister pointed out that I'm probably not closing the loop on my experiences unless I actually write about the games I play, and she's absolutely right. So any game that makes it into this category will be written about.

Where before I might have languished in a sort of gaming purgatory, wondering how best to spend my time, this system allows me to grab the next game without wondering whether it's a good use of time, and already I've seen drastic improvements, notably:

### Commitment

Without this system, I might try a game, only to start worrying that I wasn't actually making the best use of my gaming time. With this system, I've discovered a hidden source of perseverance. I'm motivated to get to the end of a game because it means I can try another game.

Do note that "getting to the end" does not mean 100% completion of the game. I'll be writing about the terrible disease of completionism at a later date.

### Quality

I like acting as if I were about to die TOMORROW. Suddenly, I want to know what the **best** things are, rather than **all** the things. Maybe you were working through an obscure series of books that wasn't all that good, but you hadn't read Lord of the Rings. Then you die. You didn't experience the foundation of modern fantasy, too bad!

With the "I could die tomorrow" philosophy, I've been prioritizing the good stuff over the it-might-be-good stuff. I've been surprised at just **how** good the good stuff is. And I'm angry at myself for saying no to quality in the name of completionism or curiosity.

### Frugality

I've decided not to buy any new games until I've finished working through my backlog. This will probably take a really long time, but it's a rule that will pay off (heh) in the end.

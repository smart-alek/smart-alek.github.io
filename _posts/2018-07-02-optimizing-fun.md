title: Optimizing Fun
---

I, like many gamers, have an obscenely large backlog of games.

It began many years ago when I received _The Orange Box_ as a gift. _Half-Life 2_ demanded to be played through something called "Steam", and I begrudgingly installed the software.

"There. Are you happy?" I asked _Half-Life 2_. "Yes," it said. "Thank you for selling your soul to Valve. We will take good care of it."

Since then, the games have piled up with alarming velocity. There's always one more game that snags me with sparkly screenshots, another tantalizing sale, the alluring promise of something **new** and **different**.

I have succumbed to many of these temptations, and the sheer weight of my backlog has paralyzed me. When I sit down to play a game, I am plagued by doubts: is this **really** the most fun I could be having right now?

It is a stupid problem to have, one that feels awkward to even describe. But it is also a modern problem. There is **so much** being produced these days that it would require several full-time jobs to actually consume it all. Even if you don't share my exact affliction, you likely have a problem with some other medium. Have you read every book you own? Or worse: every book you **want** to read? Ghastly.

When I hit the weekend, I often wring my hands, knowing that free time is **special**. And there is a tremendous urge to maximize my use of it. I am ashamed to admit how much time I've spent scrolling through my Steam library, hoping to select The Best Game for the eve.

Fortunately for myself and my sanity, I work in tech, an industry filled with people who like doing things efficiently. These engineers and product managers have developed tools and processes to Prioritize Things, and I, in a fit of productivity, have applied these processes to all the media I'm trying to consume.

Behold! My Trello board for games.

![Are you not entertained?]({{ "/assets/trello-games.png" | absolute_url }})

This board was mainly inspired by [Getting Things Done](https://hamberg.no/gtd/), with just a **dash** of [Agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). Both are lean processes designed to keep things moving, like a high-fiber diet.

My system has three objectives:

1. Prioritize Quality
2. Save Time
3. Incentivize Commitment

### Prioritize Quality

When I let my whims decide what I'm consuming, there's no quality assurance. I might **think** I know what I want, but I usually don't. So I pick a mediocre game, play it for a couple hours, experience dissatisfaction, then repeat the process with another subpar game. Madness!

If I died tomorrow, would there be games I regretted not experiencing? Yes! There's a whole list! We have a finite amount of time on this planet, and spending it on mediocrity makes me barf. I want quality games to bubble to the top of a list. Then, without thinking, I can pluck a game from the top and know I'm getting something great.

### Save Time

Games vary wildly in the amount of time they demand. You might spend 3 mind-bending hours with [_Pony Island_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/405640/Pony_Island/), or push past 100 with a behemoth like _Skyrim_. In my experience, the most impactful games are between 8-12 hours. For comparison, the first season of _Game of Thrones_ is about 9 hours, and that obviously had an impact.

Rather than specialize in a few games, I've always preferred to sample as many as I can. If I have to choose between a monster like _Skyrim_ or 25 shorter games, I am always going to pick the latter. I want to favor short, unique games over massive time commitments. This is because I love learning. And **starting** games involves a lot of learning. When I stop learning, I lose interest and look for my next educational hit.

Happily, the best games are designed to continuously offer an achievable challenge --- a magical place where the most effective learning takes place. Easy games aren't satisfying; hard games are demoralizing. Games should be played for as long as they can consistently keep you in a [flow state](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/166972/cognitive_flow_the_psychology_of_.php). In the **best** games, of course, you're in a flow state the entire time, and there is no tutorial because the game **is** the tutorial.

So! I want to play games that consistently stretch me, but I also want games to respect my time. Well-designed games do not require grinding or farming; every failure is important.

### Incentivize Commitment

While I value my time, I think "finishing" games is important, too. I put "finishing" in quotes because I'm very much **not** talking about completionism --- a crippling disease carried by most gamers.

With a few exceptions, I do not enjoy games that never end. This is because depth comes at the cost of breadth. When I ended my years-long obsession with League of Legends, I experienced an exhilarating freedom. No longer chained to endless matches, I could now funnel that time into fresh gaming experiences.

As mentioned above, though, my anxiety around the "best" use of time can be problematic. It can prevent me from fully committing to any particular game. And I think a lack of commitment can be just as damaging as an abundance.

I want to finish the games I start, which actually means I just want to reach **an** end. I don't need to find every secret door or collect all the feathers; I just want to experience **most** of what the game has to offer.

## The System

How does this system work? Does it work?

### Unreleased / Unpurchased

Games that are on my radar but haven't been released or purchased. I wanted to have a way to keep track of new games that interest me so I can buy them later.

### Backlog

Games that I own that I have not yet decided to play.

### To Play

These are games I've prioritized, either because of critical acclaim or personal interest. Generally, the games require more time as you move down the list. I did this intentionally so I could experience many **kinds** of games. There is a larger post here about breadth-first gaming versus depth-first gaming, but I'll save that conversation for later.

### Playing

Games I'm currently playing. I'm trying to keep this list as small as possible to minimize [work in progress](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/wip-limits) and [context switching](https://blog.trello.com/why-context-switching-ruins-productivity).

### Completed This Month (not visible)

Games I've actually finished this month. Currently, that's Regency Solitaire, FEZ, and Bayonetta. My sister pointed out that I'm probably not closing the loop on my experiences unless I actually write about the games I play, and she's absolutely right. So any game that makes it into this category will be written about.

Where before I might have languished in a sort of gaming purgatory, wondering how best to spend my time, this system allows me to grab the next game without wondering whether it's a good use of time, and already I've seen drastic improvements, notably:

With the "I could die tomorrow" philosophy, I've been prioritizing the good stuff over the it-might-be-good stuff. I've been surprised at just **how** good the good stuff is. And I'm angry at myself for saying no to quality in the name of completionism or curiosity.

I'm motivated to get to the end of a game because it means I can try another game.

### on saving money

I've decided not to buy any new games until I've finished working through my backlog. This will probably take a really long time, but it's a rule that will pay off (heh) in the end.

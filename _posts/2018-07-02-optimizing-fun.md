title: Optimizing Fun
---

I,
like many gamers,
have an obscenely large backlog of games.

It began many years ago
when I received _The Orange Box_ as a gift.
_Half-Life 2_ demanded
to be played through something called "Steam",
and I begrudgingly installed the software.

"There. Are you happy?" I asked _Half-Life 2_.
"Yes," it said.
"Thank you for selling your soul to Valve,
we will take good care of it."

Since then,
the games have piled up with alarming velocity.
There's always one more game
that snags me with sparkly screenshots,
another tantalizing sale,
the alluring promise of something **new** and **different**.

I have succumbed to many of these temptations,
and the sheer weight of my backlog often paralyzes me.
When I sit down
to play a game,
I am pursued by a disturbing doubt:
is this **really** the most fun I could be having right now?

It is a stupid problem to have,
one that feels awkward to even describe.
But it is also a modern problem.
There is **so much** being produced these days
that it would require several full-time jobs
to actually consume it all.
Even if you don't share my exact affliction,
you likely have a problem with some other medium.
Have you read every book you own?
Or worse: every book you **want** to read?
Ghastly.

When I hit the weekend,
I often wring my hands,
knowing that free time is **special**.
And there is a tremendous urge
to maximize my use of it.
I am ashamed to admit
how much time I've spent scrolling through my Steam library,
hoping to select The Best Game for the eve.

Fortunately for myself and my sanity,
I work in tech,
an industry filled with people
who like doing things efficiently.
These engineers and product managers have developed tools and processes
to Prioritize Things,
and I,
in a fit of productivity,
have applied these processes
to all the media I'm trying to consume.

Behold!
My Trello board for games.

![Are you not entertained?]({{ "/assets/trello-games.png" | absolute_url }})

## The System

The board above is inspired by [Getting Things Done](https://hamberg.no/gtd/),
with just a **dash** of [Agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).
Both are lean processes designed to keep things moving,
like a high-fiber diet.
Each game gets its own card,
and each card lives in a list representing its position in the overall process.
Let's take a look at the lists.

### Unreleased / Unpurchased

Games that are on my radar but haven't been released or purchased. I wanted to have a way to keep track of new games that interest me so I can buy them later.

### Backlog

Games I own that I haven't prioritized.

### To Play

These are games I've prioritized, either because of critical acclaim or personal interest. Generally, the games require more time as you move down the list. I did this intentionally so I could experience many **kinds** of games. There is a larger post here about breadth-first gaming versus depth-first gaming, but I'll save that conversation for later.

### Playing

Games I'm currently playing. I'm trying to keep this list as small as possible to minimize [work in progress](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/wip-limits) and [context switching](https://blog.trello.com/why-context-switching-ruins-productivity).

### Completed This Month (not visible)

Games I've actually finished this month. Currently, that's Regency Solitaire, FEZ, and Bayonetta. My sister pointed out that I'm probably not closing the loop on my experiences unless I actually write about the games I play, and she's absolutely right. So any game that makes it into this category will be written about.

## The Metrics

To do that,
I rank games by two metrics:
**quality** and **time**.

### Quality

When I let my whims decide what I'm consuming,
there's no quality assurance.
I might **think** I know what I want,
but I usually don't.
So I pick a mediocre game,
play it for a couple hours,
experience dissatisfaction,
then repeat the process with another subpar game.
Madness!

If I died tomorrow,
would there be games I regretted not experiencing?
Yes!
There's a whole list!
We have a finite amount of time on this planet,
so spending it on mediocrity makes me barf.
I want quality games to bubble to the top of a list.
Then,
without thinking,
I can pluck a game from the top
and know I'm getting a Quality Game.

So what **is** a Quality Qame?
This is absolutely the title of another blog post,
but for now, be content with some unexplained bullet points.

_A game is high quality if it..._

- keeps me in a [flow state](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/166972/cognitive_flow_the_psychology_of_.php) for most of its duration.
- causes an emotional reaction.
- self-contained and doesn't require external sources like wikis or guides.

Without actually playing a game,
it can be tricky to know
whether it satisfies any of these conditions.
So (unfortunately) I have to rely on trusted sources
like [Rock, Paper, Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/).

### Time

Games vary wildly in the amount of time they demand.
You might spend 3 mind-bending hours with [_Pony Island_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/405640/Pony_Island/),
or push past 100 with a behemoth like _Skyrim_.
In my experience,
the most impactful games are between 8-12 hours,
or about the length of a season of _Game of Thrones_.
Long games are more prone to bloating or padding --
you'll likely have to grind or farm at some point.
These are design smells and wastes of time.

This doesn't mean that long games are **off** the table;
they should just be **further down** the table.
This is apparently a [very French way](https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/10-ways-the-french-view-food-differently-than-americans) of consuming things.

So! This metric really boils down to two rules:

1. Play games with actual conclusions.
2. The longer the game,
the more quality you should expect.

Time is much easier to measure than quality.
The first rule eliminates games that occur in matches, sessions, or runs.
This means games like _League of Legends_, _Civilization_, and every roguelike are at an immediate disadvantage.
Sites like [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/) help me get a sense of the time required before I commit to anything.

Where before I might have languished in a sort of gaming purgatory, wondering how best to spend my time, this system allows me to grab the next game without wondering whether it's a good use of time, and already I've seen drastic improvements, notably:

With the "I could die tomorrow" philosophy, I've been prioritizing the good stuff over the it-might-be-good stuff. I've been surprised at just **how** good the good stuff is. And I'm angry at myself for saying no to quality in the name of completionism or curiosity.

I'm motivated to get to the end of a game because it means I can try another game.

### on saving money

I've decided not to buy any new games until I've finished working through my backlog. This will probably take a really long time, but it's a rule that will pay off (heh) in the end.
